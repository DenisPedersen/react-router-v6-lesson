# React Router Version 6
#### lesson 09
***


### Description

1. In the Register component add two more input fields. First Name and Last Name. 

You can inject two params into the useNavigate() hook. The first one is the path you want to navigate to, 
and the other one is a state object. That means you can transfer a state object to the location of the first param.

2. Use that knowledge to catch the state in the Confirmation component. To catch the state you will need to use
the **useLocation()** hook from "react-router-dom"
