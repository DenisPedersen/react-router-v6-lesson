#### lesson 08
***


### Description

This is going to be the last lesson.

1. Index Routes
   - if we click on the Workshops Header link, the space after our list of workshop categories
   is empty.
   - here we can use something called index routing.
   - the index route will render when we haven't clicked on any sessions links.
   - insert the code below in the main.jsx file in the comment "insert here"
   - go back to the browser and see what is happening.
