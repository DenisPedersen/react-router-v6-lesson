#### lesson 07
***


### Description

1. Now you're going to use all that you have learned in the previous section to archive the following:
   - our goal is, to show each workshop session information below the workshop link in the browser.
   - see the image below
   - use the newly added Session component to archive just that.

### Browser Image

<figure>
    <img src ="src/assets/nestedroute.png"
         alt ="cras table"
         width ="500"
         height ="350">
    <figcaption>Session Information</figcaption>
</figure>

### Hints
- you need to add another nested route in the main.jsx file.
- study closely the Session component, Specially the useParam() hook.
